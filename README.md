# Dataquest Projects
## â€œYour first 10,000 photographs are your worst." - Henri Cartier-Bresson
As an individual obsessed with information, I am very curious about the insights that could be generated from the abundance of data that we now have. 
Learning to code in Python gave me the ability to perform various statistical and machine learning analysis on data in areas that interest me and helps me to uncover their stories.
My real first foray into data science/machine learning started back in late 2018 when I first chanced upon the Dataquest website. 
Since then, I have been an active learner in this domain, seeking to apply the skills that I have learned in my professional work and personal projects. 
This git is a collection of all my initial projects done as part of the Dataquest course work
